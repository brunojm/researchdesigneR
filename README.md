Decision support for the design of patient-centered research

The objective of this software is to provide decision support for data scientist having to decide on a data science strategy for the analysis of a patient-centered research project. The structure is pretty simple, with an operational classification of multiple data science methods connected to [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to facilitate navigation. The hierarchy we use is not comprehensive, authoritative, or even necessarily correct, i.e., intended to achieve consensus. The goal is pretty pedestrian: help data scientists choose an approach when faced with a research question.

We will soon be providing installation instructions, but for now check our [Wiki](https://github.com/sporedata/researchdesigneR/wiki), where we just started adding some content about individual methods.
